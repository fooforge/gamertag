# Gamertag

An interface for accessing your XBOX Live profile and game data.

## Install 

```ruby
gem install gamertag
```

Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gamertag'
```

## Usage
This gem fetches data from two independent sources, which has several implications such as one of the sources not being available, or an increased overhead when you only want to access some of the data.  To this end the interface will allow you to access all data, just the profile data or just the played games data.


  Example: Obtaining your profile and played games.  Methods are those available to the simple profile and played games.

    profile = Gamertag::Profile.new('Belial1984')
    profile.gamertag
    profile.recent_games {|game| game.title }
    profile.played_games {|game| game.title }
    
    
  Example: Obtaining your profile and recent games only

    profile = Gamertag::SimpleProfile.new('Belial1984')

    profile.gamertag
    profile.isvalid
    profile.ischeater
    profile.isonline
    profile.online_status
    profile.reputation
    profile.gamerscore
    profile.location
    profile.motto
    profile.name
    profile.bio
    profile.avatarbody
    profile.avatarbodyssl
    profile.avatarlarge
    profile.avatarlargessl
    profile.avatarsmall
    profile.avatarsmallssl
    profile.avatartile
    profile.avatartilessl

    profile.recent_games.each do |game|
      game.title
      game.tid # Probably some arbitrary title id
      game.marketplace_url
      game.compare_url
      game.image
      game.last_played
      game.earned_gamerscore
      game.available_gamerscore
      game.earned_achievements
      game.avilable_achievements
      game.percentage_complete
    end

  Example: Obtaining your played games only

    played_games = Gamertag::PlayedGames.new('Belial1984')
    played_games.each do |game|
      game.image
      game.last_played
      game.earned_gamerscore
      game.available_gamerscore
      game.earned_achievements
      game.available_achievements
      game.average_gamerscore
      game.relative_gamerscore  => :above_average || :below_average || :undefined
    end
